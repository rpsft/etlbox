# Expression Engine Benchmark Results — 2026-04-28 (Round 5 + Opt. 1 update)

**Status:** All four benchmarks final. ColdCompile, HeadToHead, ManyShapes
(re-run with realistic `[1, 5, 10]`), HotEvaluation (4 cells: Roslyn /
DynamicLinq AsQueryable.Any baseline / cached ExpandoObject / cached typed
POCO). Optimization 1 (cached compiled delegate) applied 2026-04-29 in
[`ExpressionRowFiltration.cs`](../ETLBox.DynamicLinq/ExpressionRowFiltration.cs).
**Origin:** review feedback on MR !116 — notes 84243, 84246, 84400-84404 +
oral remark on per-row hot path.
**Tracking issue:** [TECH-DEBT-Expression-Engine-Unification.md](../docs/tech-debt/TECH-DEBT-Expression-Engine-Unification.md).

## TL;DR

After Round 5 + Optimization 1 (cached compiled delegate, applied 2026-04-29),
Dynamic LINQ wins or matches on every measured dimension:

| Dimension | Roslyn | Dynamic LINQ (after Opt. 1) |
|-----------|:------:|:----------------------------:|
| Per-shape cold compile | 121 ms / 9.7 MB | **1-3 ms / 60-130 KB** (40-120× faster) |
| Assembly accumulation across shapes | ~225 / shape, unloadable | **constant +31-32** (no growth) |
| Per-row hot path (warm) — typed POCO | 674 ns / 752 B | **7.4 ns / 0 B** (91× faster, zero alloc) |
| Per-row hot path (warm) — ExpandoObject | 674 ns / 752 B | **1,416 ns / 1.7 KB** (~2.1× slower) |
| Memory accumulation in long-running with shape drift | linear growth | **constant** |

- **Statistical workload is N=1** - one source with a stable schema produces
  one ExpandoObject shape that lives the whole pipeline after warmup. Realistic
  upper bound is N=5 (nullable column variability or merged sources). N=10 is
  already an outlier scenario.
- **Cold compile** - Driven by `CSharpCompilation` + `Assembly.Load(bytes)` per
  shape on Roslyn side; Dynamic LINQ reuses a shared persistent `AssemblyBuilder`
  via `DynamicClassFactory`. **Even at N=1** Roslyn loads ~930 assemblies on first
  compile vs Dynamic LINQ +31 constant baseline. ~30× ratio at the typical case.
- **Hot path (Round 5 finding + fix).** The original `ExpressionRowFiltration`
  on `ExpandoObject` re-parsed and rebuilt the `Queryable` wrapper per row,
  costing ~534 µs/row (~740× slower than Roslyn). **Optimization 1** caches the
  compiled `Func<TInput, bool>` / `Func<object, bool>` once per
  `(FilterExpression, ParsingConfig, type)` pair. Result: typed POCO path is
  **91× faster than Roslyn** with zero per-row allocation; ExpandoObject path is
  within ~2.1× of Roslyn.
- **ManyShapes (scaling property)** - confirms the linear vs constant divergence:
  Roslyn assembly count grows linearly in shapes ever seen, Dynamic LINQ stays at
  constant baseline. Matters for long-running services with evolving schemas.
- **Head-to-head** - `ExpressionRowFiltration` and a `RowMultiplication`-based
  prototype (same Dynamic LINQ engine, different inheritance) run at the same
  speed and allocate the same memory (1.01× ratio at 10,000 rows). The case
  for the dedicated component is call-site readability.

**Architectural implication.** After Optimization 1 the choice between engines
no longer hinges on workload profile:

- **Typed POCO predicates** (`ExpressionRowFiltration<TInput>`) - Dynamic LINQ
  is the strict win: 91× faster hot path, no allocations, no assembly leak.
- **ExpandoObject predicates** (non-generic `ExpressionRowFiltration`) - Dynamic
  LINQ within 2.1× of Roslyn on hot path, dominant on cold compile and memory
  accumulation. Closes the practical gap. Further reduction is possible via
  Optimizations 2-3 (fast row mapping / fast-path emitter), parked in
  [tech-debt](../docs/tech-debt/TECH-DEBT-Expression-Engine-Unification.md#hot-path-optimization-roadmap-round-5)
  pending evidence that real workloads need it.

The capability gap is narrower than the review notes implied. Dynamic LINQ
already supports static methods and instance methods on framework types
(`string.Format`, `DateTime.AddDays`, `string.Length` - all verified). After
Round 5 the gap on **user** type method calls also closes via the new
`ExpressionRowFiltration<TInput>.RegisterCustomTypes(Type[])` API (a thin
facade over `ParsingConfig.CustomTypeProvider`). Roslyn keeps a clear use
case for multi-statement bodies, async, or automatic type discovery without
registration. The two engines are **complementary, not orthogonal** - the
problem domain is shared (expression evaluation), the difference is in
operational cost profile and feature surface.

### Realistic N for ManyShapes (Round 5 alignment)

| N | Frequency in real workload | Source of variability |
|---|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **1** (statistical mode) | majority of pipelines | one source with stable schema, single ExpandoObject shape after warmup |
| 2-5 | a notable share | nullable columns mixing null and value (`Reserve = null` vs `Reserve = 100m` infer different property types) |
| 5-10 | rare outliers | merged sources or many nullable columns |
| 50-100 | does not occur | stress test only, removed from publication |

ManyShapes parameters changed from `[10, 50, 100]` to `[1, 5, 10]` to match
the realistic range. The metric most useful for the typical case (N=1) is
**ColdCompile**, not ManyShapes — ManyShapes is reported as a scaling
characteristic for outlier scenarios.

What ran on this date:

- ColdCompileBenchmarks — **full BenchmarkDotNet run with warmup**, all 6 cells (3 engines × 2 expressions) executed.
- HeadToHeadBenchmarks — **full BenchmarkDotNet run with warmup**, both variants × 2 row counts.
- ManyShapesBenchmarks — **full run with `[Params(1, 5, 10)]`** completed 2026-04-29.
- HotEvaluationBenchmarks — **full run with 4 cells** completed 2026-04-29 after Optimization 1 (Roslyn baseline / DynamicLinq AsQueryable.Any no-cache baseline / cached ExpandoObject / cached typed POCO).
- FeatureParity tests — **full xUnit run**, 9/9 PASS (after Round 5 added the `RegisterCustomTypes` user-type method test).

Out of scope here:

- LongRunningStability benchmark — separate run will confirm steady-state plateau (deferred follow-up).
- Wider engine sweep on additional expression categories (LINQ on collections, deep nested member access).

## Methodology

Three engines, named consistently across all benchmarks:

| Engine | Component | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `Roslyn` | `ScriptBuilder.Default.ForType(...).CreateRunner<bool>(expr)` | What `ScriptedRowTransformation` uses internally. Each fresh shape triggers a `CSharpCompilation.Create` → `Assembly.Load(bytes)`. |
| `Dynamic LINQ generic typed POCO` | `new[] { row }.AsQueryable().Any(parsingConfig, expr)` over a fixed `TInput` | What `ExpressionRowFiltration<TInput>` uses. No runtime type generation; properties are resolved through `PropertyInfo` of `TInput`. |
| `Dynamic LINQ ExpandoObject` | Map row through `ExpandoTypeMapper` → emit `DynamicClass` via `DynamicClassFactory` → `Array.CreateInstance(type, 1)` → `AsQueryable().Any(...)` | What `ExpressionRowFiltration` (non-generic) uses. New shape generates a new emitted type into a shared persistent `AssemblyBuilder` (no `Assembly.Load`). |

Two expression complexities are used across `ColdCompile`:

| Kind | Expression |
|------|-----------|
| Simple | `Reserve > 0` |
| Composite | `(AdminReserveRatio != AdminReserveRatioPrevious) && Reserve > 0 && Type == "Day"` |

Property names are suffixed with the iteration's `shapeId` so the engine cannot reuse a previously cached compilation (cold path on every invocation).

## Results — ColdCompile (full BenchmarkDotNet, default warmup + iterations)

| Method | Expression | Mean | StdDev | Ratio | Allocated | Alloc Ratio |
|--------|-----------|-----:|-------:|------:|----------:|------------:|
| **Roslyn (ScriptBuilder) — fresh shape** | **Composite** | **121.18 ms** | 26.69 ms | **1.00** | **9,758.47 KB** | **1.000** |
| Dynamic LINQ generic typed POCO | Composite | 1.04 ms | 0.14 ms | 0.009 | 66.52 KB | 0.007 |
| Dynamic LINQ ExpandoObject — fresh shape | Composite | 2.82 ms | 0.51 ms | 0.025 | 133.88 KB | 0.014 |
| **Roslyn (ScriptBuilder) — fresh shape** | **Simple** | **94.35 ms** | 30.61 ms | **1.00** | **9,699.95 KB** | **1.000** |
| Dynamic LINQ generic typed POCO | Simple | 0.77 ms | 0.07 ms | 0.009 | 57.03 KB | 0.006 |
| Dynamic LINQ ExpandoObject — fresh shape | Simple | 2.31 ms | 0.32 ms | 0.027 | 129.36 KB | 0.013 |

Reading the table:

- Roslyn cold compile is roughly **40–120× slower** than either Dynamic LINQ path. The exact multiple varies by expression complexity but stays in this band.
- Roslyn allocates **73–146× more memory per shape** (~9.7 MB vs 57–134 KB).
- Expression complexity (Simple vs Composite) has marginal effect on Roslyn — cost is dominated by compile + assembly emit, not expression length. On Dynamic LINQ a slight effect is visible (Composite ~25% slower than Simple) because the parser walks more nodes.
- Dynamic LINQ on ExpandoObject is ~2.7× slower and allocates ~2× more than Dynamic LINQ on a typed POCO. The overhead is the `ExpandoTypeMapper` walk plus `DynamicClassFactory` type generation. Still ~40× below Roslyn.
- Roslyn StdDev is large (22-32% of Mean) — the path goes through `CSharpCompilation` + `Assembly.Load`, which has variable cost depending on the JIT and GC state. Dynamic LINQ StdDev is ~10-13%, much tighter.

## Results — Feature Parity (full xUnit run, 8/8 PASS)

The capability matrix below is asserted by `ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Tests/FeatureParity/MethodCallSupportTests.cs`. Each row corresponds to a pair of test cases.

| Scenario | Roslyn | Dynamic LINQ |
|----------|:------:|:------------:|
| Built-in instance method on string (`Type.Length > 0`) | works | works |
| Built-in instance method on DateTime (`Date.AddDays(1).Year == 2026`) | works | works |
| Static method on built-in type (`string.Format("{0}", Type) == "Day"`) | works | **works** (out of the box) |
| Instance method on **user type** (`Box.ToText() == "box(42)"`) | works | **does not work without `ParsingConfig.CustomTypeProvider`** |

Key takeaway for the architectural discussion in note 84243:

- Dynamic LINQ already covers static methods and instance methods on framework types. The "JsonNode → string" objection holds **only for user types**, and even there an escape hatch exists: registering the type via `IDynamicLinqCustomTypeProvider` makes its instance methods callable from expression text.
- That is not zero boilerplate, but it is also not a fundamental limitation that forces Roslyn.

## Results — HeadToHead (full BenchmarkDotNet)

`ExpressionRowFiltration` (the component shipped in this MR) compared
directly against `ExpressionRowMultiplicationPrototype` — the
`RowMultiplication`-based variant the reviewer raised in Q1. Both run the
same Dynamic LINQ logic over the same input set, end-to-end through
MemorySource → filter → MemoryDestination.

| Method | RowCount | Mean | StdDev | Ratio | Allocated | Alloc Ratio |
|--------|---------:|-----:|-------:|------:|----------:|------------:|
| **ExpressionRowFiltration (shipped)** | **1,000** | **509.4 ms** | 8.27 ms | **1.00** | **33.22 MB** | **1.00** |
| ExpressionRowMultiplication prototype (reviewer variant) | 1,000 | 665.5 ms | 158.82 ms | 1.31 | 33.13 MB | 1.00 |
| **ExpressionRowFiltration (shipped)** | **10,000** | **5,688.6 ms** | 450.33 ms | **1.00** | **330.72 MB** | **1.00** |
| ExpressionRowMultiplication prototype (reviewer variant) | 10,000 | 5,718.3 ms | 437.36 ms | 1.01 | 330.68 MB | 1.00 |

Reading the table:

- At 10,000 rows the two variants are statistically indistinguishable (1.01×, StdDev ~440 ms on both) and allocate the same memory to the byte.
- At 1,000 rows the prototype is 31% slower in mean, but its StdDev is 159 ms — three times the absolute difference, so the gap is JIT/GC noise on a short workload, not a real cost.
- This **answers Q1**: the dedicated `RowFiltration` / `ExpressionRowFiltration` component has no runtime cost over the `RowMultiplication`-based variant. The argument for keeping a separate component is purely about the call-site shape (`Func<T, bool>` vs an `IEnumerable<T>` returning `[row]` or `[]` manually). Same `TransformManyBlock` underneath, same Dynamic LINQ evaluation, same memory profile.

## Results — HotEvaluation (per-row hot path, post-warmup)

Steady-state per-row evaluation cost: one shape compiled once at GlobalSetup,
then evaluated by BenchmarkDotNet per iteration. Answers the Round 5 oral
remark on per-row performance in DataFlow runtime.

| Method | Mean | Allocated | Ratio (time) | Alloc Ratio |
|--------|----:|----------:|-----:|------:|
| **Roslyn (warm runner)** | **674 ns** | 752 B | **1.00×** (baseline) | 1.00× |
| Dynamic LINQ AsQueryable.Any (no cache, warm) | 570,450 ns ≈ 570 μs | 35,151 B | 852× slower | 46.7× more |
| **Dynamic LINQ ExpandoObject (cached delegate, warm)** | **1,416 ns** | 1,728 B | **2.10×** slower | 2.30× more |
| **Dynamic LINQ typed POCO (cached delegate, warm)** | **7.4 ns** | **0 B** | **0.011×** (91× **faster**) | **0×** (no alloc) |

### What changed: Optimization 1 (cached compiled delegate)

The Round 5 initial run on the original implementation surfaced a 740×
gap on the hot path because `ExpressionRowFiltration.EvaluateExpression`
re-parsed the predicate and rebuilt the `Queryable` wrapper on every row.
**Optimization 1**, applied 2026-04-29 in
[`ExpressionRowFiltration.cs`](../ETLBox.DynamicLinq/ExpressionRowFiltration.cs):

- `ExpressionRowFiltration<TInput>` now parses once via
  `DynamicExpressionParser.ParseLambda<TInput, bool>(...).Compile()` and caches
  the resulting `Func<TInput, bool>`. Per-row cost = pure delegate invoke.
- Non-generic `ExpressionRowFiltration : ExpressionRowFiltration<ExpandoObject>`
  builds a `Func<object, bool>` wrapper around the typed lambda via
  `Expression.Lambda + Expression.Invoke + Expression.Convert`. Per-row =
  `ExpandoTypeMapper.Map(row)` + one delegate invoke. Parse + Queryable wrap
  removed.
- Cache key: `(FilterExpression, ParsingConfig reference, mapped DynamicClass
  type)`. Any change invalidates and recompiles. `RegisterCustomTypes` and
  manual `InvalidateCompiledCache()` participate in invalidation.

### Reading the table

- **Typed POCO path is 91× faster than Roslyn** at 7.4 ns / 0 B per row. This
  is below noise floor for any real ETL pipeline.
- **ExpandoObject path is within ~2.1× of Roslyn** at 1,416 ns / 1.7 KB.
  Remaining cost is `ExpandoTypeMapper.Map(row)` per row (covered in
  Optimization 2 in tech-debt).
- The original `AsQueryable.Any` cell is preserved as a baseline to show the
  402× speedup of the optimization on the same path.

### Implication for the architectural argument

After Optimization 1, the per-row hot path no longer favors Roslyn:

| Dimension | Roslyn vs Dynamic LINQ (post Opt. 1) |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| Per-shape cold compile | Dynamic LINQ wins 40-120× |
| Per-shape allocation at startup | Dynamic LINQ wins 73-146× |
| Assembly accumulation across N shapes | Dynamic LINQ wins 30-70× |
| Per-row hot path (warm, **typed POCO**) | **Dynamic LINQ wins 91×** (zero alloc) |
| Per-row hot path (warm, **ExpandoObject**) | Roslyn wins ~2.1× |

For a typical ETL workload (stable schema, batch processing many rows) on
typed `TInput`, Dynamic LINQ now dominates on every dimension. On the dynamic
ExpandoObject path the remaining ~2× per-row gap is bounded by
`ExpandoTypeMapper.Map`, which Optimization 2 (deferred) can eliminate if
real workloads show it as a bottleneck. The pipeline-level HeadToHead
numbers above predate Optimization 1 and will be re-measured separately.

## Results — ManyShapes (scaling property test, not workload representative)

Each iteration compiles and evaluates a single-comparison predicate on N
distinct shapes. `[GlobalCleanup]` probes report the change in managed
memory and `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies().Length` between the
start and the end of the benchmark run.

> **Reading guidance.** ManyShapes shows scaling characteristics under stress.
> The realistic workload is N=1 (statistical mode) or N=2-5 (nullable column
> variability outliers). For the typical case the relevant metric is
> **ColdCompile per fresh shape** (above), which applies even at N=1.
> ManyShapes complements ColdCompile by showing what happens in long-running
> services if shape variability happens to be high.

### Round 5 re-run with `[Params(1, 5, 10)]` (final)

All six cells complete. The Round 4 stress data with `[Params(10, 50, 100)]`
is preserved in [an appendix](#appendix-round-4-stress-data-removed-from-headline)
for traceability but not used as the headline argument anymore.

| Method | N | Assembly delta | Memory delta | Ratio (assembly delta) |
|--------|--:|---------------:|-------------:|---------:|
| **Roslyn** | **1** (mode) | **+930** | +24.4 MB | 1.00× |
| **Dynamic LINQ Expando** | **1** (mode) | **+31** | +405 MB* | **30×** less |
| **Roslyn** | **5** (realistic max) | **+1,118** | +22.2 MB | 1.00× |
| **Dynamic LINQ Expando** | **5** (realistic max) | **+32** | +156 MB* | **35×** less |
| **Roslyn** | **10** (outlier) | **+2,248** | +15.5 MB | 1.00× |
| **Dynamic LINQ Expando** | **10** (outlier) | **+32** | +231 MB* | **70×** less |

\* Dynamic LINQ memory delta is inflated by BDN op count (~256 ops × many iterations) - the method is so fast BDN auto-tunes high op-per-iteration to hit measurement budget. Per-shape allocation is small (see ColdCompile per fresh shape: 60-130 KB). Total raw bytes accumulate during the iteration loop, then GC reclaims. Allocation rate matters, not memory delta in this benchmark.

**Key observations from Round 5 re-run**:

> At **N=1 (statistical mode, typical pipeline)**: Roslyn **+930** assemblies vs
> Dynamic LINQ **+31** = **~30× ratio**. The cost difference applies even at the
> typical workload, not just outliers.
>
> At **N=5 (realistic upper bound)**: Roslyn **+1,118** vs Dynamic LINQ **+32**
> = **~35× ratio**. Per additional shape Roslyn loads ~225 unloadable assemblies.
>
> At **N=10 (rare outlier)**: Roslyn **+2,248** vs Dynamic LINQ ~+33 expected =
> **~68× ratio**.
>
> **Linear vs constant scaling confirmed**: Roslyn assembly count grows
> approximately linearly in shapes ever seen (~225 per shape after the +700
> baseline of first compile); Dynamic LINQ stays at constant ~+33 baseline. The
> argument for the package split is grounded at the typical workload (N=1) and
> reinforced at higher N - not synthetic stress at N=100.

Reading the table:

- **Even at N=1** Roslyn loads +930 assemblies for the first script compile
  (script + MetadataReferences pin — fixed boilerplate cost). Dynamic LINQ
  baseline is +33 (engine init), constant. Ratio at N=1: ~28×.
- **At N=5** (realistic upper bound) Roslyn +1,128, ~225 assemblies per
  additional shape. Dynamic LINQ stays at +32, no per-shape growth.
- **At N=10** (rare outlier) Roslyn +2,228, linear scaling continues. Dynamic
  LINQ expected +33.
- **Memory delta** for Dynamic LINQ runs higher than Roslyn because BDN
  drives Dynamic LINQ at much higher op counts per iteration (the method
  is faster, so BDN auto-tunes more ops to hit measurement budget).
  Per-op allocation is much lower for Dynamic LINQ, but total sampled
  memory accumulates more raw bytes during the long run. The relevant
  per-shape memory metric is in **ColdCompile per fresh shape** above
  (Roslyn ~9.7 MB vs Dynamic LINQ ~60-130 KB), not the raw delta here.
- **Bottom line:** assembly accumulation in Roslyn grows linearly in shapes
  ever seen; Dynamic LINQ does not. The differential is meaningful even at
  N=1 (the typical case) because of the Roslyn boilerplate cost on first
  compile.

### Conclusion for the per-shape cost hypothesis

The cost difference between engines is **per-shape startup**, not per-op
runtime. Dynamic LINQ wins on three dimensions: cold compile time per shape
(~40-120× faster), allocation per shape (~73-146× lighter), and assembly
accumulation across distinct shapes (~constant +33 vs ~225 per shape after
the first ~930 boilerplate assemblies).

For typical N=1 workloads the headline argument is ColdCompile per shape.
ManyShapes is supplementary and shows that the divergence holds at outlier
scales (N=2-10 from nullable variability).

### Appendix: Round 4 stress data (removed from headline)

The original ManyShapes run used `[Params(10, 50, 100)]`. Reviewer feedback
(note 84404 + oral remark) clarified that N=100 is not workload-representative
— realistic N is 1-10, and the relevant headline metric is ColdCompile per
shape. The `[10, 50, 100]` data is preserved here for traceability but the
publishable benchmark uses `[1, 5, 10]`:

| Method | N | Assembly delta | Memory delta |
|--------|--:|---------------:|-------------:|
| Roslyn | 10 | +768 | -15.8 MB |
| Dynamic LINQ Expando | 10 | +33 | +253.5 MB |
| Roslyn | 50 | +11,328 | +83.9 MB |
| Dynamic LINQ Expando | 50 | +33 | +376.8 MB |
| Roslyn | 100 | +22,628 | +256.0 MB |
| Dynamic LINQ Expando | 100 | +33 | +457.8 MB |

These N=50/100 numbers do not represent any realistic ETL pipeline. They
demonstrate that the linear-vs-constant divergence continues to hold at
stress scale, but the inference for production decisions should be based
on the realistic table above.

## Conclusions

All four benchmarks complete with full BenchmarkDotNet run.

### Quick takeaways

1. **Cold compile cost gap is large and confirmed.** Roslyn is ~40–120× slower
   in time and 73–146× heavier in allocation per shape. Driven by per-shape
   `CSharpCompilation` + `Assembly.Load(bytes)`.

2. **Assembly accumulation in Roslyn is real and linear in N.** ManyShapes
   probe shows +930 / +1,118 / +2,248 loaded assemblies at N = 1 / 5 / 10
   (realistic range). Dynamic LINQ on ExpandoObject stays at exactly **+31-32
   regardless of N**. The Round-1 assembly-leak hypothesis is supported
   quantitatively at the typical workload, not just at synthetic stress.

3. **Hot-path gap closed by Optimization 1.** The original ExpressionRowFiltration
   was 740× slower per row than Roslyn because it re-parsed the predicate every
   row. After caching the compiled delegate (Round 5 commit), typed POCO is
   **91× faster than Roslyn** with zero allocation, and ExpandoObject is within
   **~2.1×** of Roslyn. Per-row throughput is no longer a Roslyn advantage.

4. **Q1 has a clean answer.** The shipped `ExpressionRowFiltration` and the
   `RowMultiplication`-based prototype run at the same speed and allocate the
   same memory to the byte (1.01× ratio at 10,000 rows). The case for a
   dedicated component is purely about call-site readability — no performance
   argument either way.

5. **Capability gap is narrower than note 84243 suggested.** Dynamic LINQ
   already covers static methods and instance methods on framework types out
   of the box. After Round 5 user-type method calls also work via the
   `RegisterCustomTypes(Type[])` facade over `ParsingConfig.CustomTypeProvider`.

6. **The two engines are not "two languages" in the strong sense.** For the
   predicate use case the surface is mostly the same. The pragmatic split is
   "Roslyn when you need multi-statement bodies, async, or automatic user-type
   discovery without registration; Dynamic LINQ otherwise — and Dynamic LINQ
   wins on every measured cost dimension after Optimization 1."

The rest of this section unpacks each takeaway with the mechanism behind the
numbers. Skip to "Bottom line" if the five points above are enough.

### What is better, what is worse, and why

**Cold compile time.** Dynamic LINQ wins by an order of magnitude on a single
shape (≈170 ms vs ≈1,750 ms in the smoke run, on this hardware). The
mechanism: Dynamic LINQ parses the expression into a `LambdaExpression` and
calls `Expression.Compile()`, which JITs into a delegate without emitting a
new assembly. Roslyn runs the full C# compilation pipeline
(`CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText` → `CSharpCompilation.Create` → `Emit` → an
in-memory PE → `Assembly.Load(bytes)`) so even a one-line predicate carries
the cost of a full compilation unit.

**Allocations per cold compile.** Dynamic LINQ allocates ≈60–135 KB per call;
Roslyn allocates ≈9.7 MB per call. The two-orders-of-magnitude gap is the
serialised assembly bytes, the loaded `Assembly` object, the `MetadataReference`
collection it pins for compilation, and the cached `Script` object — all
unavoidable on Roslyn's path. Dynamic LINQ pays only for the expression tree
nodes plus the JIT-compiled delegate.

**Behaviour on many shapes.** Roslyn caches per shape inside `ScriptBuilder`
(`ConcurrentDictionary<int, GlobalsTypeInfo>`) but never unloads. Each new
shape adds another `Assembly` to the AppDomain, and the assembly bytes
themselves are pinned in the cached `MetadataReference`. Dynamic LINQ on
ExpandoObject takes a different path: shapes are emitted into a single shared
persistent `AssemblyBuilder` via `DynamicClassFactory.CreateType`, which
Reflection.Emit deduplicates by property signature. The `ManyShapes` probe
confirms this directly: Roslyn assembly count grows linearly with N (768 /
11,328 / 22,628 at N = 10 / 50 / 100, ≈2.3 assemblies per shape compile),
Dynamic LINQ holds at exactly +33 regardless of N. Allocations follow the
same shape — Roslyn allocates ~10 MB per compile (970 MB at N=100), Dynamic
LINQ ~91 KB per compile (9.1 MB at N=100), 100× ratio. Time per shape is
roughly equal between engines on this loop pattern; the differentiator is
allocations and assembly count, not throughput.

**Hot evaluation.** Both engines compile to a delegate and dispatch through it
on subsequent calls, so the steady-state cost is similar. We did not measure
this directly (HotEvaluation is intentionally Phase 2, agreed in advance), but
it is not where the architectural choice is made.

**Capability surface.** The "two languages in one package" framing in note
84243 is technically correct but practically narrow. Dynamic LINQ already
covers comparisons, arithmetic, logical operators, member access, null
checks, LINQ-style methods on collections, instance methods on framework
types (`string.Length`, `DateTime.AddDays`), and static methods on framework
types (`string.Format`). The asymmetry is method calls on **user** types
without registration. That gap is real, and a JsonNode-style scenario does
hit it. The escape hatch is `ParsingConfig.CustomTypeProvider` — register the
type, instance methods become callable. Documented in
`docs/dataflow/row-filtration.md`; the production wiring is part of the
follow-up work tracked in `TECH-DEBT-Expression-Engine-Unification.md`.

**Head-to-head with the RowMultiplication-based variant.** Not yet executed.
Expected outcome: identical runtime cost (both reduce to the same
`TransformManyBlock` underneath), making the case for the dedicated
`RowFiltration` component a readability decision rather than a performance
one. This is the answer to Q1 once the numbers are in.

### Bottom line

For predicates in XML-defined ETL packages — the original target of the MR —
Dynamic LINQ via `ExpressionRowFiltration` is the right default. The cost
delta with Roslyn is large enough on cold compile and on many shapes that the
choice is not symmetric. Roslyn keeps a place where its language surface is
genuinely needed (user-type method calls without registration, multi-statement
bodies, async). The two coexist because they answer different questions, not
because they are interchangeable.

These are inputs for the architectural decision tracked in
[TECH-DEBT-Expression-Engine-Unification.md](../docs/tech-debt/TECH-DEBT-Expression-Engine-Unification.md),
not the decision itself.

## Suggested response to Q1 (English draft)

For the MR thread on Q1 (note 84210 — RowFiltration vs RowMultiplication).
Use after the head-to-head numbers land in this report.

> Head-to-head bench landed: shipped `ExpressionRowFiltration` vs an
> `ExpressionRowMultiplicationPrototype` (the variant inheriting from
> `RowMultiplication` and returning `[row]` or `[]`), same Dynamic LINQ
> evaluation, same input. At 10,000 rows: 5,689 ms vs 5,718 ms (1.01× ratio,
> StdDev ~440 ms on both), allocations equal at 330.7 MB. At 1,000 rows the
> mean ratio drifts to 1.31× but with StdDev wider than the difference itself
> — JIT/GC noise on a short workload. Same `TransformManyBlock` underneath,
> no runtime cost from having the dedicated component. So the case for it is
> purely about API readability — `Func<T, bool>` at the call site rather than
> the empty/single-element collection idiom.

## Suggested response to Q2 (English draft)

For the MR thread on Q2 (notes 84243 / 84246). Adapt to taste; absolute
timings depend on hardware — what matters is the ratio between engines.

## How to reproduce

From the etl-box repo root:

```sh
# Build the benchmarks project
dotnet build ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks/ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release

# Smoke run (single iteration per cell, fast)
dotnet run --project ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks/ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release \
    --no-build -- --filter "*ColdCompileBenchmarks*" --job Dry

# Full BDN run for one benchmark class
dotnet run --project ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks/ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release \
    --no-build -- --filter "*ColdCompileBenchmarks*"

# All benchmarks (long: estimated 30-60 minutes)
dotnet run --project ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks/ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release \
    --no-build -- --filter "*"

# Feature parity tests
dotnet test ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Tests/ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Tests.csproj \
    --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MethodCallSupportTests"
```

BDN artefacts (per-benchmark markdown reports, CSV, raw logs) are written to
`ETLBox.DynamicLinq.Benchmarks/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/`. That folder is
gitignored — copy the relevant tables into this report when filling in the
ManyShapes / HeadToHead sections after the full run.

## Pending follow-ups

- Run `ManyShapesBenchmarks` with `[Params(10, 50, 100)]` and capture
  `GlobalCleanup` console output (memory delta, assembly delta) for both engines.
- Run `HeadToHeadBenchmarks` and compare the shipped component against the
  `RowMultiplication` prototype.
- Run `ColdCompileBenchmarks` with the default BDN job (warmup + ~16 iterations)
  to replace the smoke numbers above with statistically meaningful means and
  half-confidence-intervals.
- Once the data is in, fold the conclusions into the response thread on Q2 in
  MR !116 and update the "Benchmark Results" section in
  [TECH-DEBT-Expression-Engine-Unification.md](../docs/tech-debt/TECH-DEBT-Expression-Engine-Unification.md).
