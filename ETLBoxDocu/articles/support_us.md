# Support us

## Open Source

ETLBox was created and designed by my as an open source project and licensed under the MIT license. It is completely
free of charge to use in any of your projects, doesn't matter if they are personal or commercial. In fact,
I think the personal use of an ETL framework is very limited, and I hope this tool can help you in your day-to-day business
problems.

### Improving this software

Feel free to send me suggestions how to improve this software. If you find a bug, ćame up with a new feature
or have any other question, please contact me directly or raise a new issue on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/roadrunnerlenny/etlbox).

## Getting professional help

I started to create this toolbox about 2 years ago and I'm still happy to improve and maintain it. 
Though I did put a lot of effort in it, I still think of it as my favorite project and enjoy to add new code
and functionalities to it.

I am a software developer with focus on C# and Sql, working more than 10 years in BI and ETL environments.
All effort I put into this toolbox so far was done in my spare time - I still need to earn money doing other things. 

If you like this toolbox, and really want to support it,  please have a chat with me about some training sessions
or other data integration issues that you would like to have solved with ETLBox. I would be happy to support you
 on a professional basis.

Just send me an e-mail to (andreas.lennartz@gmail.com). 
You can find my full contact information in the [imprint](imprint.md).

## Clean coding

At first glance, it can look like that some of the task are not really adding big value to your project. But in accordance to clean coding, 
having written everything in a format which is easy-to-read and easy-to-understand, you are able to produce code that is easier to maintain. Having your code "clean" 
allows you to focus on the important parts of your logic and not be distracted by code lines that your brain need to "unravel" every time you go over them.
If you are interested in clean coding, you should read the "bible" on that topic, written by 
[Robert C. Martin: Clean Code](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=andreaslennar-21&linkId=CAKVL4PO6YCRW53L)

### Books written by me

If you are able to understand and read german, I recommend you my own book: 
[Mehr als Clean Code - Gedanken zur Softwareentwicklung](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3735736513/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=3735736513&linkCode=as2&tag=andreaslennar-21&linkId=D6HR6S6YAQ65Q3S6)
Purchasing it would also be a small contribution to this project.
