## Odbc setup

For excel: download latest driver
- Odbc driver needs to be 64bit if using 64bit .NET core 
- (Visual Studio 2019 16.4 changed default behvaiour for xunit Tests - they now run with .NET Core 32bit versions)
- Recommended: Driver Access >2016 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920
- Old driver: Driver Access >2010 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255
- Start "ODBC data sources 64-bit" , just add "Microsoft Access driver" as System DNS
 - enter a data source name,e.g. Accesss - no further configuration needed
- Everything else is derived from Connection String

### ODBC on Mac
```
brew install unixodbc
brew install mdbtools
```

## Line break settings

- current tests and files for comparison are created under windows and have \r\n as LineBreak (instead of \n only)
- if cloned under mac os or linux with git clone, the line breaks will be converted automatically into \n
- now tests will fail, because the as-is files created in windows will have different line breaks that than the to-be files in the cloned project
- to avoid the converting the line breaks, you need to set the core.autocrlf=true in global git config:
```
git config --global --add core.autocrlf true
```
After doing this, you need to clone the project (if you already cloned it, remove it and clone it again)
