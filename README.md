## ETLBox.Classic

This is a fully open-source (MIT) fork from original ETLBox library.
Starting version 2.0 the author of the original library decided to close the source and commercialize the newer branch.
ETLBox.Classic is aiming at keeping original 1.x branch up to date with .Net and DB libraries.

### Documentation note

## What is ETLBox

A lightweight ETL (extract, transform, load) library and data integration toolbox for .NET. Source and destination
components let you read and write data from the most common databases and file types. Transformations allow you to you
harmonize, filter, aggregate, validate and clean your data.

Create your own tailor-made data flow with your .NET language of choice. ETLBox is written in C# and offers full support
for .NET Core.


## Why ETLBox

ETLBox is a comprehensive C# class library that is able to manage your
whole [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)
or [ELT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_load,_transform). You can use it to create your own dataflow pipelines
programmatically in .NET, e.g. with C#. Besides a big set of dataflow components it comes which some control flow task
that let you easily manage your database or simple execute Sql code without any boilerplate code. It also offers
extended logging capabilites based on NLog to monitor and anlayze your ETL job runs.

ETLBox is a fully functional alternative to other ETL tools like Sql Server Integrations Services (SSIS). Creating your
ETL processes programatically has some advantages:

**Build ETL in .NET**: Code your ETL with your favorite .NET language fitting your teamâ€™s skills and that is coming with
a mature toolset.

**Runs everywhere**: ETLBox runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It is written in the current .NET Standard and
successfully tested with the latest versions of .NET Core & .NET.

**Run locally**: Develop and test your ETL code locally on your desktop using your existing development & debugging
tools.

**Process In-Memory**: ETLBox comes with dataflow components that allow in-memory processing which is much faster than
storing data on disk and processing later.

**Manage Change**: Track you changes with git (or other source controls), code review your etl logic, and use your
existing CI/CD processes.

**Data integration**: While supporting different databases, flat files and web services, you can use ETLBox as a
foundation for your custom made Data Integregation platform.

**Made for big data**: ETLBox relies
on [Microsoft's TPL.Dataflow library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library)
and was designed to work with big amounts of data.

## Data Flow and Control Flow

ETLBox is split into two main components: Data Flow and Control Flow Tasks. The Data Flow part offers the core ETL
components. The tasks in the Control Flow allow you to manage your databases with a simple syntax. Both components come
with customizable logging functionalities.

### Data Flow overview

ETLBox comes with a set of Data Flow component to construct your own ETL pipeline . You can connect with different
sources (e.g. a Csv file), add some transformations to manipulate that data on-the-fly (e.g. calculating a sum or
combining two columns) and then store the changed data in a connected destination (e.g. a database table).

To create your own data flow , you basically follow three steps:

- First you define your dataflow components (sources, optionally transformations and destinations)
- link these components together
- tell your source to start reading the data and wait for the destination to finish

Now the source will start reading and post its data into the components connected to its output. As soon as a connected
component retrieves any data in its input, the component will start with processing the data and then send it further
down the line to its connected components. The dataflow will finish when all data from the source(s) are read, processed
by the transformations and received in the destination(s).

Transformations are not always needed - you can directly connect a source to a destination. Normally, each source has
one output, each destination one input and each transformation at least one input and one or more outputs.

Of course, all data is processed asynchronously by the components. Each compoment has its own set of buffers, so while
the source is still reading data, the transformations can already process it and the destinations can start writing the
processed information into their target. So in an optimal flow only the current row needed for processing is stored in
memory. Depending on the processing speed of your components, the buffer of each component can store additional rows to
optimize throughput.

#### Data Flow example

It's easy to create your own data flow pipeline. This example data flow will read data from a MySql database, modify a
value and then store the modified data in a Sql Server table and a csv file, depending on a filter expression.

Step 1 is to create a source, the transformations and destinations:

```C#
var sourceCon = new MySqlConnectionManager("Server=10.37.128.2;Database=ETLBox_ControlFlow;Uid=etlbox;Pwd=etlboxpassword;");
var destCon = new SqlConnectionManager("Data Source=.;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=ETLBox;");

DbSource<MySimpleRow> source = new DbSource<MySimpleRow>(sourceCon, "SourceTable");
RowTransformation<MySimpleRow, MySimpleRow> rowTrans = new RowTransformation<MySimpleRow, MySimpleRow>(
    row => {  
        row.Value += 1;
        return row;
    });
Multicast<MySimpleRow> multicast = new Multicast<MySimpleRow>();
DbDestination<MySimpleRow> sqlDest = new DbDestination<MySimpleRow>(destCon, "DestinationTable");
CsvDestination<MySimpleRow> csvDest = new CsvDestination<MySimpleRow>("example.csv");
```

Now we link these elements together.

```C#
source.LinkTo(trans);
rowTrans.LinkTo(multicast);
multicast.LinkTo(sqlDest, row => row.FilterValue > 0);
multicast.LinkTo(csvDest, row => row.FilterValue < 0);
```

Finally, start the dataflow at the source and wait for the destinations to rececive all data (and the completion message
from the source).

```C#
source.Execute();
sqlDest.Wait();
csvDest.Wait();
```

### Data integration

The heart of an ETL framework is it's ability to integrate with other systems.
The following table shows which types of sources and destination are supported out-of-the box with the current version
of ETLBox.
**You can *always* integrate any other system not listed here by using a `CustomSource` or `CustomDestination` - though
you have to write the integration code yourself.**

|  Source or Destination | Support for                          | Limitations                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|  Databases             | Sql Server, Postgres, SQLite, MySql  | Full support                                  |
|  Flat files            | Csv, Json, Xml                       | Full support                                  |
|  Office                | Microsoft Access, Excel              | Full support for Access, Excel only as source |
|  Cube                  | Sql Server Analysis Service          | Only XMLA statements                          |
|  Memory                | .NET IEnumerable & Collections       | Full support                                  |
|  Cloud Services        | Tested with Azure                    | Full support                                  |
|  Any other             | integration with custom written code | No limitations                                |

You can choose between different sources and destination components. `DbSource` and `DbDestination` will connect to the
most used databases (e.g. Sql Server, Postgres, MySql, SQLite). `CsvSource`, `CsvDestination` give you support for flat
files - [based on CSVHelper](https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/). `ExcelSource` allows you to read data from an
excel sheet. `JsonSource`, `JsonDestination`, `XmlSource` and `XmlDestination` let you read and write json from files or
web service request. `MemorySource`, `MemoryDestinatiation` as well as `CustomSource` and `CustomDestination` will give
you a lot flexibility to read or write data directly from memory or to create your own custom made source or destination
component.

### Transformations

ETLBox has 3 type of transformations: Non-blocking, partially blocking and blocking transformations. Non-blocking
transformations will
only store the row that is currently processed in memory (plus some more in the buffer to optimize throughput and
performance). Partially blocking transformations will load some data in the memory before they process data row-by-row.
Blocking transformations will wait until all data has arrived at the component before it starts processing all records
subsequently.

The following table is an overview of the most common transformations in ETLBox:

|  Non-blocking      | Partially blocking   | Blocking            |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
|  RowTransformation | LookupTransformation | BlockTransformation |
|  Aggregation       | CrossJoin            | Sort                |
|  MergeJoin         |                      |                     |
|  Multicast         |                      |                     |
|  RowDuplication    |                      |                     |
|  RowMultiplication |                      |                     |

#### Designed for big data

ETLBox was designed for performance and is able to deal with big amounts of data. All destinations do support Bulk or
Batch operations. By default, every component comes with an input and/or output buffer. You can design your data flow
that only batches or your data is stored in memory, which are kept in different buffers for every component to increase
throughput. All operations can be execute asynchrounously, so that your processing will run only within separate
threads.

### Control Flow - overview

Control Flow Tasks gives you control over your database: They allow you to create or delete databases, tables,
procedures, schemas or other objects in your database. With these tasks you also can truncate your tables, count rows or
execute *any* sql you like. Anything you can script in sql can be done here - but with only one line of easy-to-read C#
code. This improves the readability of your code a lot, and gives you more time to focus on your business logic.

Code tells - here is some example code, without writing the whole "boilerplate" code by ADO.NET.

```C#
var conn = new SqlConnectionManager("Server=10.37.128.2;Database=ETLBox_ControlFlow;Uid=etlbox;Pwd=etlboxpassword;");
//Execute some Sql
SqlTask.ExecuteNonQuery(conn, "Do some sql",$@"EXEC myProc");
//Count rows
int count = RowCountTask.Count(conn, "demo.table1").Value;
//Create a table (works on all databases)
CreateTableTask.Create(conn, "Table1", new List<TableColumn>() {
    new TableColumn(name:"key",dataType:"INT",allowNulls:false,isPrimaryKey:true, isIdentity:true),
    new TableColumn(name:"value", dataType:"NVARCHAR(100)",allowNulls:true)
});
```

### Logging

By default, ETLBox uses and extends [NLog](https://nlog-project.org). ETLBox already comes with NLog as dependency - so
you don't need to include additional packages from nuget. In order to have the logging activating, you just have to set
up a nlog configuration called `nlog.config`, and create a target and a logger rule. After adding this, you will already
get logging output for all tasks and components in
ETLBox. [Read more about logging here](https://etlbox.net/articles/overview_logging.html).

## Getting ETLBox
